Business Employment Dynamics

Based on the the BLS series of gross job gains and gross job losses statistics indicate that the US economy has experienced an average job gain of 28,846.62 per period between 2010 and 2022. The lower quartile of job gains is 28,122.0, which means that 25% of the job gains are below this figure. Similarly, the upper quartile of job gains is 30,346.0, indicating that 25% of the job gains are above this figure.
Furthermore, the data suggests that job gains below 24,786 could be outliers and values of job gains above 33,682 could also be outliers. This implies that such gains are not common and may indicate significant changes in the economy, such as large-scale layoffs or the creation of many new jobs due to an industry-wide expansion.
Between 2010 and 2022, the US experienced an average job loss of 27,316. The lower quartile of job losses is 25,859, indicating that 25% of job losses were below this figure. Similarly, the upper quartile of job losses is 28,145, indicating that 25% of job losses were above this figure.
Additionally, the information suggests that job losses below 22,430 could be outliers, while job losses above 31,574 could also be outliers. This implies that job losses falling outside of these ranges are not typical and may not be representative of the overall trend in the job market.

Note
The accuracy of projections for individual occupations is subject to error because of the many unknown factors that may affect the economy over the projection period. Furthermore, while occupational employment projections and related job outlook information can provide valuable inputs to the career decision-making process, 
they should not be the sole basis for a choice of career.

Unemployment Rate by industry and by age group

The first plot shows us the unemployment rate over time 2010-2023 for six industries such as retail trade, information, health care, real estate, leisure and manufacturing. It can be seen that the retail trade had the highest unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic , reaching a peak of 16.2% in April 2020. And the plot also  suggests that the information industry had a lower impact during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic periods compared to other industries and occupations
Second plot suggests that the unemployment rate for all age groups generally decreased from 2010-2020, with a few spikes during economic downturns. Plot also suggests that unemployment rates tend to be higher for younger age groups. And 35-65 was relatively lower than 16-19. It’s also worth noting that the unemployment rate for the age group 65 and over was the lowest among all age groups both before and during the pandemic. It’s possible that 65+ individuals have more experience and skills in their field, which make them more competitive in the job market. Also they may have more stable employment histories and established networks that can help them find a new job opportunities. 
Top 10 jobs that will be on Demand by 2031 -based on employment changes

By 2031, there will be a high demand for software developers, with an employment change of 370.6% and % change of 26. Median salary in 2021 was $120,730. From this information, we can say that demand for software developers is expected to increase significantly over the next decade and that individuals with bachelor degree in software development or related field will be well positioned to take advantage of this trend. Additionally, the high median annual wage for software developers suggests that this is a lucrative career path for those with necessary skills and qualifications. 

By 2031, there is expected to be a 40.5% increase in employment for data scientist, with percentage % of 35.8. The median annual wage for data scientists in 2021 was $100,910 and bachelor degree is typically required to enter this field. This data suggests that data science is rapidly growing field with promising job prospects and a competitive salary. Individuals with bachelor degree in data science or related field may be well positioned to take advantage of this trend as well. 


We recommend marketing in the states with higher unemployment rates such as Nevada 5.5% and Oregon 4.8%. It can be a good strategy for businesses because with higher unemployment there may be a larger pool of jobs seekers looking to work, which increase the likelihood of finding the qualified employees for open positions.
